# New Books Module

This module helps display the new books list from a report generated by the New Books API (https://github.com/OviattLibrary/NewBooksAPI).

## Getting Started

After copying the files to the appropriate Drupal module directory, simply go to the Modules section in the Drupal setup and enable the module. If there is a need to change what gets stored in the database then modify the new_books.install file as necessary.

### Prerequisites

Need to run alongside the New Books API obtained from the following URL: https://github.com/OviattLibrary/NewBooksAPI. The API files can go anywhere in your server setup. Just make sure to remember the path to the API and make adjustments to your module configuration as necessary.

## Tests

No automated tests available at this time.

## Deployment

## Built With

* No additional frameworks required other than a Drupal setup (tested with Drupal 7).
